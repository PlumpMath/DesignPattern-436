# Decorator Pattern

The Decorator allows your to modify an object dynamically

You would use it when you want the capability of inheritance
with subclasses, but you need to add functionality at run time

It is more flexible than inheritance

Simplifies code because you add functionality using many
simple classes

Rather than rewrite old code you can extend with new code
